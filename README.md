![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/freeai-utils)

#### Freeai-Utils is a lightweight Python library that puts the power of popular AI models right in your hands. No external binaries, no convoluted setup. Just clean, readable code.

**🚀 Small and Mighty Models**: Models are smartly chosen between **81–242M parameters**, fast enough for real-time use, accurate enough for tasks.

**✍️ No More Boilerplate**: Hate writing boilerplate or messing with low-level APIs? Just use the built-in defaults or customize them when needed.

**⬇️ One setup command, then offline**: After a single setup command, "**freeai-utils setup -y**". all models are cached locally. Your entire toolkit then runs offline, no internet required.

**Note**: This library focuses on being simple to use, even if it means sacrificing accuracy. It's great for beginners or anyone who wants to explore AI features without dealing with complex code. Just call the functions, it handles the rest.

## Features

- **Audio**: record WAV/MP3 (fixed, toggle, silence-triggered)
- **Audio-to-Text**: OpenAI Whisper transcription & language detection 
- **Speech-to-Text**: Using Vosk models for real-time transcription from a microphone
- **Web Search**: scrape Google results
- **Image**: caption generation & OCR (EasyOCR)
- **TTS**: text-to-speech via gTTS or pyttsx3
- **PDF-DOCX-Reader**: extract text and images from pdf and docx files
- **Document Filter**: extract and rank relevant content from documents using an extractive QA model
- **Translator**: Provides automatic language detection, translating content into your specified target language. (both online and local)
- **LocalLLM**: Small Qwen model for offline use or as a chatbot without an API key.
- **ImageGenerator**: Easy interaction with SDXL Turbo and SD1.5 models for image generation (for UI and performance, consider using AUTOMATIC1111)
* **Gemini API**: Interact with Google Cloud Gemini models via your API key

  * *Note: This works best with Google accounts that have no billing method added yet (completely free to use with limits).*

## Installation

Before installing `freeai-utils`, you need to install PyTorch manually based on your system and desired configuration (CPU or CUDA).

### 🔧 Prerequisite: Install PyTorch

Visit the official PyTorch installation guide:

👉 [https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally](https://pytorch.org/get-started/locally)

Choose your system (OS, package manager, Python version, CUDA version), and copy the appropriate install command.

### 📦 Install `freeai-utils`
```bash
pip install freeai-utils
```

* **Install Dependencies related to AI Features :**
    ```bash
    freeai-utils install-deps ai
    ```

No need to install extra executables or clone large repositories — everything works out of the box with `pip`.

## 📝Models download 
```bash
freeai-utils setup
# Will ask you for confirmation

freeai-utils setup -y
# Will skip confirmation prompt
```

>This will help downloads default models for most functional classes (excluding image generation).

For 🎨 **image generation** models:
```bash
freeai-utils setup ICF
```

For more detailed control over which models to download:
```bash
freeai-utils help
```
>This will displays a list of setup options for specific model types. You can also trigger downloads programmatically by instantiating the relevant class.

### 🚀 Optional GPU Performance Boost

For GPU users, if you want to take advantage of faster attention using `xformers`, install it separately (remember to choose it base on your system and your cuda version):

## Test Environment

This library has been tested on laptop with the following specifications:

**CPU**: Intel Core i5-12500H
**GPU**: NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3050 4GB GDDR6
**RAM**: 32GB DDR4
**OS**: Windows 11 Home 64-bit
**CUDA Version**: CUDA 12.6

Performance may vary depending on system specs. The selected models and safetensors were intentionally chosen to remain lightweight. All features, including image generation have been tested to run smoothly on GPUs with just 4GB of VRAM, such as the RTX 3050.
